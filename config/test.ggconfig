# SO! Welcome to my (Goga Tamas) ASCII config-file reader! This, right here, is a comment.
# Try running this file through the parser to see it's capabilities!

# This is your general formula:
# <id1> = <id2> = ... = <value>
# LET'S BREAT IT DOWN!

# Identifiers must start with with either an alphabetic or an '_' (underscore). They can contain number too!
id = "like so"
_id = true
id1 = 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288

# Redefinition works:
_id = false

# Supported escape sequences (within strings):
#   - \n -- newline;
#   - \t -- tab;
#   - \" -- quote;
#   - \\ -- backslash.
# Escape sequences are not supported outside of strings!
# "\" not followed by the characters specified above are treated as backslash.
# Multiline strings are OK too. "=" & "#" are permitted in strings as well.
# Single quotes "'" carry no special meaning.
string_esc_seq = "\nSupported escape sequences (within strings):\n\t- \\n -- newline;\n\t- \\t -- tab;\n\t- \\\" -- quote;\n\t- \\\\ -- backslash.
Multiline strings are OK, just be aware of it's side effects!"

# Syntax can be as disgusting as you want:
	bleah1   	=
		 bleah2
	=   bleah3=
	      "horrible syntax"

# Even unreadable:
falseNot = tru1e = true fassle = false_= trueNot = false

# Multiline comments are not supported.
# You'll have to be "clever".
