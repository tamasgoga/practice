A template library that implements fractions on [arithmetic types](http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/arithmetic_types). Since this is an old project, I hereby declare that the *source is the official documentation*. I've only ever compiled it with ```C++14```.

If you, for whatever reason want to use this, drop **gg_fractions.hpp** into your project. For examples, check out **main.cpp**.
